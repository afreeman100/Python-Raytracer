# Raytracer
A raytracer created for advanced computer graphics. Includes diffuse + specular lighting, shadows, and can render 
geometry loaded from OBJ files. Objects can have procedurally generated marble textures applied to them using Perlin 
noise.

Run ray_caster.py to render a scene, and all the objects within it. Runtime has been enhanced using
bounding spheres and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) however rendering complex meshes can still take some time. Reducing
the size of the camera canvas will make rendering faster, but result in a lower resultion image.
